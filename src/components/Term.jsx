                Jobify may provide one (1) free domain name for up to one year,
                with a new purchase of an annual or bi-annual subscription plan.
                The domain will be included for the lifetime of your Jobify
                account, and the domain will be registered in your name and is
                yours to keep, as long as you cover any applicable domain
                registration fees following the first year. The free domain name
                only applies to certain top-level domains (e.g. .com, .net, and
                .org) when signing up for a new plan.

                You are responsible for providing correct and complete data
                regarding the domain name holder (“Registrant”) and the
                administrative contact when registering the domain name. The
                technical contact in all cases will be Jobify, Inc. Before
                applying for a domain name, it is your responsibility to check
                that the domain name does not violate the rights of any third
                party or contravene any applicable law, rule or regulation. We
                may defer activation of a domain name until payment of the
                agreed fees for the registration services has been received.
                Jobify is in no position to influence the allocation of the
                domain name by the Registrar. We can neither guarantee that the
                requested domain names will be allocated to you and/or that
                allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor
                guarantee their continued existence. Any information we provide
                regarding the availability of a domain name is based on the data
                provided by third parties and only refers to the time that
                information is requested. The domain will not be deemed as
                allocated before registration of the domain in the name of you,
                the Registrant, and its entry in the database of the Registrar.

                  calendar days before your domain expires (even if that date

                a domain name can be renewed post-expiry and what fees will be

                new registrant anywhere in the world to register the domain name
                anew. Further, you agree that Jobify may charge the credit card

                On certain occasions, domain name registrations may become the
                subject of a legal challenge. If Jobify is made a party to any

                you agree to be responsible for all of Jobify’s costs and legal

                        An email is Spam if, among other things: (a) the
                        Recipient’s personal identity and context are irrelevant
                        because the message is equally applicable to many other
                        potential recipients; (b) the Recipient has not
                        verifiably granted deliberate, explicit and
                        still-revocable permission for it to be sent; and (c)
                        the transmission and reception of the message appears to
                        give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.

                        Spam is an issue of consent, not content. A Recipient
                        should “affirmatively opt-in,” or expressly consent to
                        receiving the message, either in response to a clear and

                        The U.S. CAN-SPAM Act regulates and establishes
                        requirements for commercial messages, gives Recipients
                        the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out
                        tough penalties for violations. Other international
                        regulations and laws also apply to electronic marketing,
                        and while we cannot give legal advice, we encourage you
                        to become familiar with these laws, especially if you

                        If you receive Spam complaints or run into compliance
                        problems, or if Jobify identifies a potentially
                        problematic contact list, we will first ask questions to
                        try to understand your business as well as your
                        marketing goals. If we determine that a list is not
                        consent-based or is too old or problematic to work with,
                        we will require that it be removed from your account. In
                        certain instances, we may ask you to find another
                        service provider because our goals are simply not
                        compatible.
